# Lab 8: Building HTML Forms with Prompting
Welcome to Lab 8! Today, you'll learn how to create HTML forms – the building blocks for collecting information on the web, like contact forms or sign-up sheets. This lab is a bit different: instead of us giving you all the code, you'll practice using an AI tool like Gemini to learn and implement these new concepts yourself! This will help you develop valuable AI prompting skills for future learning and problem-solving.

## Part 1: Exploring Forms with Gemini
**Goal**: Learn about various HTML form elements and their attributes by effectively prompting an AI tool

### Your Task
1. Open `forms.html` in your browser and code editor. You'll primarily be adding content here.

2. **Prompt Gemini**: Start by asking about HTML forms. For example:
    * "What are the most common HTML form elements?"
    * "How do I create a text input field in HTML?"
    * "Show me an example of an HTML form with a submit button."
    * "What is the `action` attribute in an HTML form?"
    * "What's the difference between `<input type='radio'>` and `<input type='checkbox'>`?"

3. **Experiment**: As you get information from Gemini, add different form elements to your `forms.html` file. Try to include:
    * A text input field
    * A password input field
    * Radio buttons
    * Checkboxes
    * A dropdown menu
    * A text area
    * A submit button

4. **Don't worry about backend functionality** – your form won't actually send data anywhere. Focus on the HTML structure and user interface.


## Part 2: Styling Your Form with CSS
**Goal**: Apply CSS to make your HTML form visually appealing and user-friendly.

### Your Task
1. Once you have a basic form structure in forms.html, switch to `forms.css`.

2. **Prompt Gemini**: Ask Gemini for CSS styling tips for forms:
    * "How do I style input fields in CSS?"

    * "Give me CSS to make my form elements look nice and aligned."

    * "How can I style a submit button?"

    * "What CSS properties are good for form accessibility?"

    * "How can I use Flexbox to lay out my form fields neatly?"

3. **Implement Styles**: Use the information from Gemini and your own creativity to style your form. Focus on:

    * Making input fields easy to see and use.

    * Adding padding, margins, and borders to improve readability.

    * Styling your submit button.

    * If you're feeling adventurous, try using Flexbox on your form elements or their container to align them horizontally or vertically!


## Reflection on AI for Learning
As you work through this lab, consider:
* How did using Gemini help you learn about HTML forms?
* What types of prompts were most effective for getting the information you needed?
* What were the benefits of learning this way compared to traditional instruction? What were the challenges or limitations?
* How might you use AI tools to learn other new coding concepts in the future?

### Feeling stuck? 
* If Gemini isn't giving you what you need, try rephrasing your prompt or breaking your question into smaller parts.
* Consult traditional references like [W3Schools HTML Forms](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp).
* Ask a coach or peer for help or to brainstorm prompt ideas.


#### Happy Coding!
