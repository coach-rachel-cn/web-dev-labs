# Lab 6: CSS Positioning & Flexbox Practice
This lab explores CSS positioning and introduces the power of Flexbox for responsive web layouts. You'll observe different positioning behaviors and then dive into hands-on Flexbox practice.

## Part 1: CSS Positioning Demo
**Goal**: Understand how different CSS position property values affect element placement. This is a reference demo; no coding is required in these files, unless you want to experiment!

### Demo Overview
Open `demo.html` in your browser and `demo.css` in your code editor. Observe how elements behave with:

* `position: static;`: Elements flow naturally. This is the default value for `position`

* `position: relative;`: Elements move relative to their normal position.

* `position: absolute;`: Elements are removed from flow and positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.

* `position: fixed;`: Elements stay fixed relative to the browser viewport, even when scrolling.


## Part 2: Flexbox Playground!
**Goal**: Gain hands-on experience with core CSS Flexbox properties to control element layout.

### Your Task
1. Open flexbox.html in your browser and styles.css in your code editor.

2. Follow the challenges outlined as comments in styles.css (starting around line 47) to arrange the colorful boxes.

3. Experiment with the following Flexbox properties on the .container class:

    * `display: flex`;
    * `flex-direction: (row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse)`
    * `justify-content: (flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly)`
    * `align-items: (flex-start, flex-end, center, stretch, baseline)`
    * `flex-wrap: (wrap, wrap-reverse)`

4. Stretch Challenges: Explore `align-self`, `order`, `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and try centering a single item.


### Feeling stuck? 
If you run into a roadblock or want to explore advanced layouts, describe your desired outcome to an AI tool like Gemini and ask for flexbox property suggestions or explanations. Remember to keep in mind that using AI is not a replacement for your learning - think about how to use it to strengthen your understanding of the content!

#### Happy coding!
