    <h1>Understanding the CSS Position Property</h1>
    <p>This demo illustrates how the values for the CSS position property affect HTML element placement on a web page.</p>

    <div class="demo-section">
      <h2>1. Static (Default)</h2>
      <div class="static-box">Static Box (Default)</div>
      <p>This box has <strong>position: static;</strong> This is the default position value. It flows normally in the document and cannot be moved with `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` properties.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="demo-section">
      <h2>2. Relative</h2>
      <div class="relative-parent">
        <div class="relative-box">Relative Box</div>
        <p>This box has <strong>position: relative;</strong>. It stays in the document flow but can be moved relative to its normal position using `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right`. It can also serve as the positioning context for `absolute` children.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="demo-section">
      <h2>3. Absolute</h2>
      <div class="absolute-container">
        <p>This container relative position to act as the positioning context for the absolute box inside.</p>
        <div class="absolute-box">Absolute Box</div>
        <p>This box has <strong>position: absolute;</strong>. It's removed from the document flow and positioned relative to its nearest *positioned* ancestor (like its `.absolute-container` parent). If no positioned ancestor exists, it's positioned relative to the `<body>`.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="demo-section high-content">
      <h2>4. Fixed</h2>
      <div class="fixed-box">Fixed Box</div>
      <p>Scroll down to see this box stay in place! A <strong>position: fixed;</strong> box is positioned relative to the browser viewport. It stays in the same spot even when the page scrolls. Use `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` to place it.</p>
      <p>This container has filler content to make the page scrollable:</p>
      <div class="scroll-filler"></div>
    </div>
