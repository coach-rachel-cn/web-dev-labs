# Lab 1: Intro to HTML & Your First Web Page üåê

In this lab, you'll embark on your web development journey by learning the fundamental building blocks of every website: **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language). You'll discover how to structure content and create your very first web page.



## Lab Goal

Learn the basics of HTML to structure content on a web page, including headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links, while starting your "About Me" project. 


### Files

* `index.html` - Your main HTML file where you'll begin creating your web page

<br>

## Challenges

Complete the challenges outlined in the comments within your `index.html` file. These challenges will guide you through creating your "About Me" page.

### Skills You'll Practice

* **Understanding Web Dev Basics**: Get an introduction to what web development and front-end development entail
* **Basic HTML Tags**: Use foundational HTML tags like `<h1>` (headings), `<p>` (paragraphs), `<ul>` or `<ol>` (lists), `<img>` (images), and `<a>` (links) 
* **HTML Attributes**: Learn how to add attributes to HTML tags to provide additional information (e.g., `src` for images, `href` for links)
* **Structuring Content**: Organize your web page content using various HTML elements.
* **Starting Your First Project**: Begin building a personal "About Me" web page.

### Feeling stuck?

* Consult references like W3Schools or MDN Web Docs for HTML tag documentation.
* Check in with a coach or peer.
* Use an AI tool like Gemini to explain concepts or help debug your code...but remember that this does not take the place of your learning :)
