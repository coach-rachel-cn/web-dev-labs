    <p><strong>Note</strong>: the hyperlinks below will not work in the VS Code Edu preview pane, but you can manually navigate to each of the files from the file tree and run code with the play button. Alternately, you can publish your website and open it in a new tab; the links will open from the published version of the site. You can unpublish your site once you finish working on the lab!</p>
