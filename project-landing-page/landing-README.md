# Final Project: Build a Landing Page
Welcome to your final project for the Web Dev Club! Over the next few weeks (Weeks 5-9), you'll apply everything you've learned about HTML and CSS to build a multi-page landing page website. This is your chance to showcase your creativity and skills!

## Project Inspiration & Planning
Your final project can be:
* A **personal portfolio page** to highlight your current and future Code Next work.
* A **landing page for a local business or organization** in your community.
*A **clone or redesign of an existing webpage**
* Have another idea? Discuss it with your coach?

### Planning Process
* **Brainstorm**: What makes a good landing page? Think about purpose, audience, and visual appeal
* **For a community business page**: What improvements can you make to an existing design? Can you reach out to the organization for ideas?
* **For a personal portfolio**: What aspects of your personal brand do you want to communicate? What work do you want to showcase?
* **Visualize**: Sketch out paper prototypes or wireframes for each page of your website. This is crucial for planning before you start coding
* **Don't rush the planning!** A solid plan makes the building process much smoother.

## Skills to Demonstrate
* HTML Structure: use a variety of HTML tags to create well-organized content and structure

* CSS Styling: Implement visually appealing and engaging styles using CSS

* Responsive Design: Your website should be responsive and adapt well to different screen sizes

* Flexbox: Effectively use flexbox to control the layout and positioning of elements.

* Accessible Design: Implement principles of good, accessible design to ensure your site is usable by everyone.

* Non-Interactive (for now!): The project does not need to be interactive. Don't worry about complex actions when a user clicks an element (beyond links or hover effects with pseudo-classes).

## Suggested Project Timeline
* Week 5 - Project introduction & planning
    * Goal: Thoroughly brainstorm your project topic and begin detailed planning.
    * Action: Sketch out wireframes/paper prototypes for all intended pages of your website

* Week 6 - Building HTML
    * Goal: Build out your HTML structure and create additional pages for your website
    * Action: Translate your wireframes into HTML and add at least 1-2 additional HTML files (e.g. an "About" or "Projects" page in addition to homepage)

* Week 7 - Integrating CSS & Flexbox
    * Goal: Apply CSS for style and positioning to your multi-page project
    * Action: Style pages with CSS and implement well-designed visual effects

* Week 8 - Responsive Design Refinements
    * Goal: Refine your HTML and CSS, focusing on flexbox and responsive design techniques
    * Action: Implement flexbox, transitions, and pseudo-classes, and consider adding an HTML form (e.g. a "Contact" page), remembering that the form won't have backend functionality yet

* Week 9 - Final Touches & Project Showcase
    * Goal: Add finishing touches to the current version of your landing page project
    * Action: Review pages for consistency and completeness, ensure all project requirements are met, and prepare to showcase your work!
    * **Note**: It's unlikely you'll "finish" your project entirely today. Instead, focus on completing this version of your project. Think about what you would continue to add, revise, or refine if you had more time, or if you revisit this project in the future.

## Using AI Tools
Feeling stuck or want to enhance your project?
* **Code Review with Gemini**: Ask Gemini to review parts of your HTML or CSS code. You can prompt it to identify potential errors, suggest improvements for readability, or optimize for performance.

* **Create a README with Gemini**: You can even use Gemini to help you draft a simple README file for your specific project to explain its purpose and features.

* **Explain a Concept**: If you're struggling with a specific CSS property or HTML tag, ask Gemini for a simpler explanation or an example.

Remember to **always critically evaluate AI suggestions** and ensure they align with your project goals and best practices.
