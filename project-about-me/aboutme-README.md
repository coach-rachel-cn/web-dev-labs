# Project 1: About Me!
For your first project, you will work over several weeks to build a personal "About Me" webpage. This project is your canvas to tell your story, showcase your interests, and demonstrate your growing web development skills.

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create a multi-page "About Me" website that reflects your personality and showcases your skills in HTML and CSS. You'll focus on building a well-structured, visually appealing, and user-friendly site.

### Core Project Requirements
By the end of the project (weeks 4-5), your "About Me" project should include:

1. **Multiple HTML Pages**: Your project should consist of at least two linked HTML pages (e.g., index.html for your main page and goals.html or hobbies.html for a secondary page).

2. **Clear Structure**: You should use appropriate headings for organization, and use `div`s or sections to group your content logically. Include paragraphs for blocks of text and use ordered and unordered lists as appropriate!

3. **Media**: Add at least two images and ensure that each image has descriptive alt text for accessibility. You can embed a video if you choose!

4. **Links**: Include examples of both absolute and relative links in your project.

5. **Styling with CSS**: Style your page with external CSS to style the colors, fonts, spacing, size and alignment of your content.

6. **Design Principles**: Apply at least three web design principles to your project and consider implementing accessibility features (beyond alt text) such as semantic HTML elements.

7. **Code Quality**: Use comments to explain sections of your code and leverage whitespace to make sure that the HTML and CSS are easy to read.

### Project Timeline
* Week 2 - Sketch a paper prototype of your website and begin writing the HTML

* Week 3 - Continue building out HTML and begin adding CSS to style your website content

* Week 4 - Finalize HTML content and continue refining CSS to align to design principles and best practices for accessibility

* Week 5 (optional) - Add styling by class and id and implement semantic HTML in your About Me project to make your website more accessible

### Using AI Tools
For this project, you can consider using AI tools like Gemini for:
* Brainstorming ideas or content
* Generating `alt` text for images
* Explaining concepts or assisting with debugging
* Getting feedback on semantic HTML and accessibility

Remember! Using AI tools does not substitute for learning. Think about how you can leverage AI to deepen and expand what you are learning.
