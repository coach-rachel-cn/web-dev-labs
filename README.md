# Code Next Intro to Web Development Labs
Welcome to the Code Next Web Development Club labs! These exercises are designed to give you hands-on practice with the core technologies of the web: HTML for structure and CSS for styling. Along the way you will also practice using AI tools like Gemini to strengthen and deepen your understanding of the web dev learning content.

## What to Expect in Each Lab
Each lab is structured to help you build your web development skills incrementally:

* **Goals**: A clear objective for what you'll learn and achieve.

* **Tasks**: Step-by-step instructions to guide your work.

* **Code Snippets**: Starter code or examples to help you get going.

* **Stretch Challenges**: Opportunities to go beyond the basics and explore more advanced concepts.

* **AI Integration Opportunities**: Suggestions on how to use AI tools like Gemini to deepen your understanding, debug, or even generate code.

## Key Skills You'll Practice
Throughout these labs, you'll develop not just coding skills, but also durable skills vital for any tech professional:

* **Computational Thinking**: Breaking down problems, recognizing patterns, and designing solutions.

* **Critical Thinking**: Evaluating code, designs, and AI outputs.

* **Problem-Solving**: Identifying and resolving issues in your code.

* **Creativity**: Expressing your ideas through web design.
