<!-- LAB 2: MORE HTML ELEMENTS! -->
<!-- Time to add more structure, links, and discover new elements for your web page! -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">

        <!-- Challenge 1: Page Title -->
        <!-- Add a <title> tag to be about an influential person of YOUR choosing! -->
        

    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Challenge 2: Write Content about your chosen influential person -->
        <!-- You will need to replace the content below with information about your chosen person. -->
        
        <!-- Start with a main header for your influential person's name -->


        <!-- Add 2-3 paragraphs about your chosen influential person here -->
        <!-- You can include biographichal information, their accomplishments, or why you think they are influential -->
        
        

        <!-- Challenge 3: Add an Image with Alt Text -->
        <!-- Use the <img> tag to add at least one picture of your influential person to your page. -->
        <!-- Note that you should be citing the source of the image if it is not yours! -->
        <!-- Remember to include descriptive 'alt' text for accessibility. -->
        


        <!-- Challenge 4: Create an Absolute Link -->
        <!-- Add a link (<a>) that goes to an *external website* about your influential person (e.g., their official website, a Wikipedia page) -->
        <!-- Place this link inside a paragraph (<p>) and give it descriptive text like "Learn more about [Person's Name]". -->
        


        <!-- Challenge 5: Create a Relative Link -->
        <!-- Add another link (<a>) but this time to a *local HTML file* you might create later, like 'achievements.html', that would contain more details about your chosen person. -->
        <!-- Put this link inside its own paragraph (<p>) -->
        


        <!-- Challenge 6: Group Content with Divs -->
        <!-- Use <div> tags to organize the content you just wrote ⬆️ into logical sections about your chosen person. -->
        <!-- For example, you might have one div for their early life/career and another for later achievements. -->
        <!-- Nest the existing tags inside your new <div>s -->
        


        <!-- Challenge 7: Explore New HTML Elements -->
        <!-- Visit https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp to find 2 new HTML elements you haven't used yet. -->
        <!-- Experiment by adding them to your webpage to enhance it in some way! -->
        

        <!-- Challenge 8: HTML Comment Practice -->
        <!-- Add comments throughout your HTML to describe your code, such as how each of your divs are organized  -->
        <!-- This is helpful when you or other devs need to quickly glance at a file and get a sense of what it's about  -->
        
        

        <!-- 🚀 STRETCH CHALLENGES! Go further with your HTML skills! -->

        <!-- Stretch 1: Semantic HTML Exploration (with AI Integration) -->
        <!-- Review your <div> tags from above. Can any be replaced with more semantic HTML tags -->
        <!-- like <header>, <main>, <section>, or <footer> to better describe their content? -->
        <!-- Use an AI tool like Gemini to ask about semantic HTML and its benefits for accessibility. -->
        <!-- Try implementing some of Gemini's suggestions! -->


        <!-- Stretch 2: Inspect with Developer Tools -->
        <!-- Publish your website in the bottom-left corner and open the link in a Chrome browser.  -->
        <!-- Right-click on any element and select "Inspect." -->
        <!-- Explore the "Elements" tab to see your HTML code live.  -->
        <!-- Try making a temporary change (e.g., editing text or attributes) directly in DevTools. -->
