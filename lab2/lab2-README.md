# Lab 2: More HTML Elements!

In this lab, you'll continue building on your HTML foundation by exploring more essential tags to structure your web page. You'll add various content types, create links, and start organizing your page for clarity and future styling.

<br>

## Lab Goal

Expand your HTML knowledge by using new tags to structure content, add images, create links, and organize your page into logical sections about your chosen influential person.

### Files

* `index.html` - Your HTML file where you'll add content and structure based on the challenges.

<br>

## Challenges

Complete the challenges outlined in the comments of your `index.html` file. Each challenge guides you to build out a different part of your "About Me" page.

### Skills You'll Practice

* **HTML Structure Tags**: Using tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<img>`, and `<a>` to present information.
* **Linking Pages**: Creating **absolute links** (to external websites) and **relative links** (to other HTML files you'll create).
* **Image Integration**: Adding images and understanding the importance of **`alt` text** for accessibility.
* **Content Grouping**: Using **`<div>` tags** to logically organize sections of your page.
* **HTML Comments**: Adding comments (``) to describe your code.
* **Exploring New Elements**: Discovering and experimenting with HTML tags you haven't used yet.

## Feeling stuck?

* Consult references like W3Schools or MDN Web Docs for HTML tag documentation.
* Check in with a coach or peer.
* Use an AI tool like Gemini to explain concepts or help debug your code...but remember that this does not take the place of your learning :)
