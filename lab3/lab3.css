li {
    
}


/* Challenge 7: Adjusting Size, Alignment, and Margin */
img {
    /* Set a specific width and height for your image (because it's huge!) */

    /* If you are not sure what these properties are doing, look them up using documentation! */


    /* Box Model practice - add margin to your image */
    /* See how margin adds space *outside* the border, pushing other elements away from it. */

    
}


/* Challenge 8: Box Model - Choose Your Own Adventure! */
