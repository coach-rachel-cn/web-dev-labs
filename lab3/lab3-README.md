# Lab 3: Styling with CSS & Applying the Box Model
In this lab, you'll dig into CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to make your web pages visually appealing. Your main focus will be on understanding and applying fundamental CSS properties, including those that control colors, fonts, and especially the Box Model for spacing.

<br>

## Lab Goal
Apply foundational CSS properties to pre-existing HTML content, focusing on styling elements and understanding how the Box Model (`border`, `padding`, `margin`) controls layout and spacing.

### Files
* `index.html` - HTML file containing pre-filled content for you to style
* `styles.css` - the CSS file where you'll write all your styles

<br>

## Challenges
Complete the challenges outlined in the comments of both `index.html` and `styles.css`

### Skills You'll Practice
* Linking External Stylesheets: Connecting your HTML to your CSS
* Element Selectors: Targeting and styling HTML elements like `<h1>, <p>, <ul>, <li>`, and `<img>`
* Colors & Fonts: Changing text and background colors, and adjusting font families and sizes
* The Box Model:
    * `border`: Adding lines around elements
    * `padding`: Creating space inside an element, between its content and its border
    * `margin`: Creating space outside an element, pushing other elements away
* Size & Alignment: Controlling width, height, and centering elements.

<br>

### Feeling stuck?
* Consult references like W3Schools or MDN Web Docs for CSS property documentation
* Check in with a coach or peer
* Use an AI tool like Gemini to explain concepts or help debug your code...but remember that this does not take the place of your learning :)

#### Happy Styling!
